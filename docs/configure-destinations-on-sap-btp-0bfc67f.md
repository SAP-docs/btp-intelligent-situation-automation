# Configure Destinations on SAP BTP

You need to use the *Destinations* editor in the SAP BTP cockpit to configure destinations. For more information about configuring destinations, refer to [Create HTTP Destinations](https://help.sap.com/viewer/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/Cloud/en-US/783fa1c418a244d0abb5f153e69ca4ce.html).

Create a destination pointing to your SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud system with the URL of the system.

> ### Note:  
> -   A single subaccount must be connected to an SAP S/4HANA or an SAP S/4HANA Cloud system. All configured destinations must be from the same system. If you want to connect to another SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud system, you need to use another subaccount. Or you can unsubscribe from the service and subscribe again. This time use the destination pointing to the new SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
> 
> -   The URL of a destination must contain only the base URL of the SAP S/4HANA or SAP S/4HANA Cloud system.
